Sanctum EDR is an Endpoint Detection and Response proof-of-concept product I am building, that I will use to try combat modern malware techniques that I develop.

I have started a blog series on Sanctum, you can check it out [on my blog here](https://fluxsec.red/sanctum-edr-intro). I'm keeping track of the progress and milestones of the project there, so please check that out!

Currently in its early stages, I have a plan for the project which I will update in due course.

I am electing to build this in Rust because:

1) I love Rust
2) I want to learn Windows driver development in Rust
3) I love offensive security, and I want to demonstrate and learn defensive techniques at a low level & technical level
